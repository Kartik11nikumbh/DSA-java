# Find Length of Loop in Linked List

## Problem
Given a linked list, find the length of the loop if it exists.
Return 0 if no loop is present.

## Approach
- Use Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm
- Find the starting node of the loop
- Traverse the loop to count nodes

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## Language
- Java
